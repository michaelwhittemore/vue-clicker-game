    <p>
        You find yourself in a backwater mining settlement. The husks of abandoned buildings loom over
        rusting excavators and long dead robots. Inside one of these structures you find a grimy but still usable ore
        refiner.
        You also find an automaton fabricator. It's primitive by modern galactic standards, with some steel you
        could probably create a simple mining robot. At the edge of town an open pit descends into the mines.
        You ready your pickaxe.
