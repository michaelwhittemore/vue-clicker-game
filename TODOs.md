# I think there are two options to start with 
* I guess we start with a game tick 
* A 'click' button
* https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management - we will need a reactive state object to track our state - I think we will need a separate `gameTick` function from the state

# General Notes
* Will need to mention this was to learn vue and to refresh my typescript knowledge 
* `env.d.ts` need to make sure all my types are here
* look into a typescript guide, feel like I'm missing some stuff
* typescript eslint
